# clothes-shop
## About
This project was created for me to get some more hands on experience with full stack development. Hopefully I will be able to accomplish the following as I work on this project:
- The front/back ends of this project will be separated into two different folders.
- The website can show different products for sale in a clothes shop.
- The user can add a certain number of an item into a basket and go to checkout.
- The user going through with a purchase will update the number of items available in our clothes shop. (If there's 10 dresses available then buying one means there's 9 available to other shoppers.)
- Documentation to run this website on your end will be added here.
- Issues will be fixed as I notice them.
- Commits will have good descriptions to help anyone who looks at this repo in the future so I can look back on my work and explain it to someone unfamiliar with the project.
